# Java Programming: Solving Problems With Software
My notes and code produced when going through [Duke University Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming/home)

## Week 1
Mostly introductory videos plus some [programming resources](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//course2/index.php) and instructions how to use BlueJ

### Tips for Learning Programming
1. Do a little every day
2. Don't give up
3. Follow the seven-step process
4. Read the documentation
5. Use the live coding videos and assignments
6. Ask for help in the forums!

### Using Forums: How to Ask for Help Effectively
1. Check FAQ pages and existing threads before creating a new thread
2. Start a new thread if you have a new question
3. If you need to post code, use the code formatting box

## Fundamental Java Syntax and Semantics Module
